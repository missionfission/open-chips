Top-Level Architecture
The design includes:

Input Interface Module: Receives and buffers incoming cells.
Cell Processing Module: Parses headers and determines the output port.
Switch Fabric: Routes cells from input to the correct output port (e.g., using a crossbar).
Output Interface Module: Buffers and transmits cells to output ports.
Controller: Implements arbitration, scheduling, and VPI/VCI translation.
